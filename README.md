Advance Battle Hex Wars 2013: War on Planet Rexicon - CS 4332 Fall 13 Project

Project Proposal
 
Project Name: Advance Battle Hex Wars 2013: War on Planet Rexicon (WoPR)
 
Team Members: Jacob Marius and John Chilton
 
Pitch: A turn-based strategy game on a hex grid, playable with a controller.

Project Goal: To create a turn based game functioning similar to “war games” styled board games. Two players will produce armies and issue them orders in order to secure territory, engage in skirmishes, and ultimately defeat their opponent.

Primary Objectives/Features: Functioning game where players can construct a variety of units, and issue orders to those units on the map. Combat handled on the map screen.

Secondary Objectives/Features: Design a combat system where upon a unit attacking another, an interface is brought up allowing each player to make tactical decisions that influence the attack’s outcome. Develop an ai, allowing for single user play.

Back story: Rexicon is currently in the middle of many different wars between different factions battling for control of their area (and for many varied other reasons). This game isn’t about them. This is about all of the modern soldiers that have died and descended into hell, fighting their way back to Rexicon to claim it from the living.
 
Game Outline: Players will take turns using xbox controllers to build units from controlled points, move units around a hex based map, and issue orders for the units at their destinations. Play will occur until either a side destroys all enemy units on the map or gains control of the enemy headquarters and becomes the victor.

Milestones:
Have a working map implementation
Simulate game turns and economy
Enable unit production
Be able to order units around
Enable combat resolution
Implement unit variety

Possible future planned milestones:
Develop AI opponent
Have sub-game when engaging in “melee” combat
Animated units

Big Accomplishments: Features we would like to show off are the strategic and combat mechanics of the turn based strategy game. Should the secondary objective pertaining to ‘making units attacking each other a fleshed out system where both sides issue orders’ be  achieved, this would be the key focus point of any presentation.
